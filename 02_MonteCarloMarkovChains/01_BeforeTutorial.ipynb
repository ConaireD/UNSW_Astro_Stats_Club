    "In previous tutorials, we defined Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "$$P(\\theta \\mid D) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) \\, \\pi(\\theta)}{\\mathcal{Z}}$$\n",
    "Recall that each of the are:\n",
    "- $P(\\theta|D)$ - The posterior, i.e. what we believe about our parameters *after* seeing the data.\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$ - The likelihood, i.e. the probability of seeing the data given a particular set of parameters (the physics and the noise).\n",
    "- $\\pi(\\theta)$ - The prior, i.e. what we believe about our parameters *before* seeing the data\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{Z}$ - The evidence, i.e. the total probability of observing your data, averaged over all parameter values weighted by the prior. In practice, treated as a normalisation constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about Bayes theorem, is that if we only care about parameter estimation (and not model comparison), we can treat the evidence as a normalisation constant and drop it, leaving:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta \\mid D) \\propto \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) \\, \\pi(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do care about model comparison, go back to the Nested Sampling notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bayes 101 notebook, we fit a model to a spectral line by doing a grid search. This model had 4 parameters, we fixed two of them, and tested 250 values each for the other two parameters. This meant, that in total, we tested $250^2 = 62,500$ parameter combinations. If we didn't fix the other two, we would have had to test $250^4 \\approx 3.9$ billion parameter combinations. Obviously this is way too many to check. This problem is known as the curse of dimensionality. The basic problem is that high dimensional spaces have a lot of volume, most of which we don't care about. Let's see this in practice by using Monte Carlo methods\n",

    "### Name:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo is a region within the city state of Monaco (near the French and Italian border). The Casino de Monte-Carlo was opened in 1863 to save the state from bankruptcy. The casino was so successful that income tax in Monaco was abolishd in 1869. It is likely the most famous casino in the world, and is the casino that inspired the casino in the James Bond novel and movie \"Casino Royale\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Statistics:\n",
    "Like suprisingly many physics and statistics inventions, Monte Carlo methods origniated during the Manhatten Project (i.e. the nuclear bomb project) at Los Alamos. The Monte Carlo method was invented by Stanislaw Ulam and later formalised with the help of John von Neumann.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stanislaw Ulam\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanislaw Ulam was a Polish-Born (later American) mathematician. He and his brother left Poland to the USA on a voyage funded by his father and uncle. Eleven days after departure, the Nazis had invaded Poland which they took over within two months. Within two years, most of his family was murdered during the Holocaust. \n",
    "In 1943, he (may have) asked John von Neumann (who he had met several years earlier in Warsaw) to find him a war job. In October, he was sent an invitation to join an unidentified project in New Mexico. At the time, he was working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As he knew little of New Mexico, he checked out a New Mexico guide book from the university library. In the checkout card inside the guide book, the names of several of his colleagues appeared, all of whom had disappeared to work on the Manhatten Project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1946, he suffered from encephalitis -- a severe, life-threatening inflammation of the brain. This temporarily led to cognitive impairment (difficulty with mathematics, memory issues, etc). During his recovery, he had to relearn basic mathematics. While recovering, he played the solo card game solitare frequently and obsessively. While doing so, he started to wonder about the probability of a successful game. Rather than doing difficult combinatorial analysis, he realised that brute-force random sampling would be easier. This is where the Monte-Carlo method originates from. Allegedly, Nicholas Metropolis coined the name Monte-Carlo after Ulams fathers gambling problem and the name stuck. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many of his Manhatten project colleagues, he was neither a nuclear hawk nor dove. Perhaps the reason that he did not become a dove was because the project was ostenstibly started in order to defeat the Nazis (who murdered most of his family), and not the Japanese. He did later support anti-nuclear testing treaties.\n",

    "- It's positively skewed — you occasionally get terrible 3–4\" conditions, but rarely get sub-arcsecond seeing\n",
    "- It's correlated hour to hour — a period of good seeing is more likely to be followed by another hour of good seeing than a random draw from the overall distribution (similar atmospheric conditions persist)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model this as a Markov chain in exactly the same spirit as the weather example. Instead of a transition matrix, we have a transition rule: this hour's seeing depends on the previous hour's seeing, plus some noise, with a tendency to drift back toward the site's typical value. This is an autoregressive process (AR(1)) — \"autoregressive\" just means \"the next value depends on the previous value,\" which is exactly the Markov property.

    "After Stanislaw Ulam came up with Monte Carlo sampling for answering the question about the proportion of solvable solitaire games, he described his idea to John von Neumann. Von Neumann immediately realised its significance for solving a major unsolved problem at Los Alamos: neutron diffusion within fissile material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core problem was this. In a nuclear weapon, a neutron enters the bomb core and one of several things happens: it gets absorbed by a nucleus and triggers fission (releasing more neutrons), it gets absorbed without fission, it scatters off a nucleus and changes direction and energy, or it escapes the material entirely. Whether the bomb works (whether you get a sustained chain reaction) depends on the balance of these outcomes averaged over enormous numbers of neutrons, each taking a random walk through the material. Each neutron's path is a stochastic trajectory through 3D space with random scattering angles, random energy losses, and probabilistic absorption. The probability of each event depends on the neutron's energy, the local material composition, and the density, which itself is changing because the material is imploding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, the physicists would need to solve the [Boltzmann transport equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation), which governs neutron behaviour in a bomb core. But solving this was analytically intractable for realistic bomb geometries. Yet the physicists did have the necessary nuclear data: mean free paths, scattering cross-sections, energy transfer distributions, etc. What Ulam and von Neumann realised is that you don't need to solve the integral. You can just simulate individual neutrons: pick a starting position and direction, draw random numbers to decide what happens at each step, follow the neutron until it either escapes or gets absorbed, and repeat for thousands of neutrons. The bulk quantities of interest (the neutron multiplication factor, the energy deposition profile, whether a given geometry achieves criticality) emerge as averages over many simulated histories. This is Monte Carlo: each neutron plays a random game, and you estimate the physics by playing the game many times and counting outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1947, von Neumann wrote a letter containing an 81-step pseudocode which was essentially the first Monte Carlo algorithm designed for electronic computation. He proposed tracking 100 neutrons through 100 collisions each and estimated that it would take 5 hours on ENIAC. In 1948, the first simulations were complete. Crucially, the Monte Carlo approach meant you could change the bomb geometry (make the plutonium pit thicker, add a uranium tamper, change the explosive lens configuration) and rerun the simulation to see how it affected the chain reaction. Before Monte Carlo, these design decisions relied on crude analytical approximations and physical intuition. After Monte Carlo, you could iterate computationally. This is a large part of why the hydrogen bomb program progressed as fast as it did in the early 1950s.\n",

    "In 1949 in Los Angeles, a symposium on Monte Carlo methods was held. The attendees included von Neumann, Tukey, and Neyman among others.

    "John was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1903. He was a true prodigy and was able to memorise and recite very lengthy documents. By 17, while still in high school, he had co-published a paper on Cantor's set theory. After being discouraged from pursuing pure mathematics by his father, he came to a compromise: John would complete a degree in chemical engineering at ETH Zurich while simultaneously completing a PhD in mathematics at the University of Budapest. At age 22 he earned his PhD. He was extremely prolific, writing many papers while still in Europe. In 1930, he started working at Princeton as faculty while younger than 30. Allegedly, he was often mistaken for a graduate student. He would often host parties and was known for flowing cocktails (he drank a lot). Perhaps related, he was also known to be a terrible driver, having at least once crashed his car into a tree. Apparently, an intersection near Princeton was informally named \"von Neumann corner\" as he frequently crashed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was not the only Hungarian who worked at Los Alamos. In fact there were a surprising number not only from Hungary, but from his high school specifically. Around the time of the Manhattan Project and the following years was the first time that \"flying saucers\" (or UFOs, or UAPs) were culturally significant. This led to conversations around Los Alamos about them, including one that involved Enrico Fermi coining the Fermi Paradox (\"If the universe is so apparently habitable, where are all the aliens?\"). An often joked solution was that they were already here and they called themselves Hungarians. This was due to the large number of freakishly smart Hungarians around, including von Neumann, and the (now outdated) belief that the Hungarian language was isolated from any other language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1943, Oppenheimer invited von Neumann to Los Alamos. He was an expert in the non-linear physics of hydrodynamics and shock waves. His principal contribution to the project was to the implosion nuclear bomb (\"Fat Man\" style) rather than to the gun-type bomb (\"Little Boy\" style). The implosion type bomb is what ended up being more effective, and is the design of modern nuclear weapons. A problem that was becoming apparent during the Manhattan Project was that gun-type bombs, in which a conventional explosive shoots a bullet piece into a target piece to compress it into supercriticality, did not work for the man-made plutonium they had. The implosion style bomb, in which a spherical piece of plutonium is surrounded by precisely timed explosions in order to compress it into criticality, was being worked on, but many doubted it would work. Von Neumann was a major supporter of the implosion design and worked on it extensively due to his knowledge of hydrodynamics and shock waves. His invention of the explosive lens design was what led to the bomb's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a darker note, von Neumann also sat on the target selection committee. His knowledge of shock wave reflections led to a calculation that optimised explosion height for maximised destruction. An airburst at the right height produces a Mach stem (a reinforced shockwave from the interaction of incident and reflected waves) that dramatically increases destructive potential, but also reduces fallout. He also supported nuking Kyoto, reasoning that the destruction of the cultural capital would be psychologically devastating. This was overruled, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki were selected instead. After WW2, von Neumann consulted for many military agencies in the US. He was also a strong advocate for \"preventative\" war, in which the USA would attack the Soviets before they obtained nuclear weapons. He was quoted saying \"If you say bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today?\". He did, however, support Oppenheimer when his patriotism was under attack, and allegedly warned Edward Teller that his colleagues at the Livermore lab were too reactionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1955, like many of his colleagues, he was diagnosed with cancer, possibly due to witnessing many nuclear explosions. As the cancer spread to his brain, his mental faculties deteriorated and he was moved to a private room after his screams and shouts disturbed other patients. His phones were monitored, as military officials worried that he might accidentally leak nuclear secrets in his delirium. There is no moral to this story.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ratio $P(\\theta'|D)/P(\\theta_n|D)$ is greater than 1, so $\\alpha = \\min(1, \\text{something} > 1) = 1$. We always accept. The chain moves to the new point. This makes sense: if the proposed position is more probable, we should go there.\n",

    "2. The proposed point has equal posterior density ($P(\\theta'|D) = P(\\theta_n|D)$):\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio is exactly 1, so $\\alpha = 1$. We always accept. The chain moves. This also makes sense: there's no reason to prefer one point over another if they're equally probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The proposed point has lower posterior density ($P(\\theta'|D) < P(\\theta_n|D)$):\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio is between 0 and 1, and we accept with exactly that probability. Concretely: if the proposed point is half as probable as the current point, the ratio is 0.5 and we accept with 50% probability. If it's a hundred times less probable, the ratio is 0.01 and we accept with 1% probability. We draw a uniform random number $u$ between 0 and 1, and accept if $u < \\alpha$. Otherwise, we stay put and record the current position again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This third case is the important one. The chain can move to lower-probability regions, but it does so reluctantly and in proportion to how much worse they are. This is what allows the chain to explore the full shape of the posterior, including its tails and secondary peaks, rather than getting stuck at the single highest point. If we only ever accepted uphill moves (cases 1 and 2), the algorithm would just be an optimiser that finds the MAP. By occasionally accepting downhill moves, it becomes a sampler that maps out the entire distribution.\n",

What you should see, now that the proposal width is small relative to the posterior width, is that almost every proposal lands near the current position and is thus accepted. You should have an acceptance rate of $>50%$. This sounds good, but look at the trace plots. You should see that the period stays around 20 days, rather than 30 days. This is because it is incredibly unlikely that a proposed point will stray far from the current position (of around 20 days). \n",

While it does explore parameter space, it is wasting a lot of computational cycles: many points are being proposed, evalutated, and rejected for no gain. While this is not ideal, we do get a better posterior than the too small case. Typically, you want an acceptance rate of ~1-25%. \n",

    "## Practical Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialisation\n",
    "**Where should you start you chain?** Hogg & Foreman-Mackey (2018) recommend initialising near a reasonable estimate. For example, near the maximum likelihood solution, or near a value you expect from your prior knowledge. You can initialise randomly within the prior, but this wastes computational cycles on burn-in. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are concerend that your posterior might be multimodal**, initialise multiple chains at different random locations. If they all converge to the same place that is good. If they don't, then you need to take some care. See the discussion on multi-modality in the main tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinning\n",
    "You will sometimes see recommendations to \"thin\" your chain. This means keep only every $k$-th sample, discarding the rest. The only reason why you would do this is for storage purposes. It throws away valid (if correlated) information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on `emcee`\n",
    "In a lot of astronomy papers, you will often see the package `emcee` used (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). It is an affine-invarient$^†$ ensemble sampler. `emcee` uses an ensemble of walkers that collectively adapt to the posterior geometry, avoiding the need to manually tune a proposal distribution. However, `emcee` is fundamentally a Metropolis-like sampler and does not use gradient information (which we will be using later). This means it struggles in high dimensions (~>10). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning\n",
    "Tuning of the proposal distributions can only be done during burn-in. You cannot tune while collecting final samples, as this would violate the Markov property.\n",

Nevertheless, you will see Metropolis-Hastings talked about everywhere, with little comment on the Metropolis algorithm alone. \n",

    "In the Metropolis algorithm, the proposal distribution is symmetric. The probability of proposing $\\theta'$ from $\\theta$ is the same as the probability of proposing $\\theta$ from $\\theta'$. The Gaussian proposal we used satisfied this. Metropolis-Hastings generalises the algorithm to allow for a non-symmetric proposal distribution. If the proposal distribution is not symmetric, you would be violating the *detailed balance* condition (see the upcoming section). Thus we need to correct for the asymmetry. We do this by modifying the acceptance ratio, so it becomes:\n",

    "2) When the proposals were too large, almost every jump lands outside the thin typical set shell, and most proposals are rejected.\n",
    "3) Goldilocks issue: in higher dimensions, the typical set becomes increasingly thin. When Metropolis needs to propose a new position, it must choose a very specific set of directions that lie on the typical set. However, the number of directions in higher dimensions grows exponentially, so the probability of randomly guessing a good direction falls dramatically.\n",

(a) If the proposal variances are large then the proposals will stray too far away from the typical set and are rejected. (b) Smaller proposal variances stay within the typical set and hence are accepted, but the resulting transition density concentrates tightly around the initial point.

    "In order to make large jumps away from the initial point, and into new unexplored regions of the typical set, we need to exploit the geomettry of the typical set.

We need a way to create this vector field from the information contained within the target distribution. \n",

    "## The Gradient\n",
    "The natural information that we have not exploited yet is the gradient of the target density. The gradient defines a vector field in parameter space that is sensitive to the geometry of the target distribution. This seems promising, but there is a pretty big issue - the gradient points towards the mode of the distribution, and away from the typical set. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a hurdle. Can you think of any situation of a vector field pointing to a single point, but there is a way to use that vector field to draw paths that don't follow the field?\n",

    "  Perhaps something like this?\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilise the information in the gradient, we need to complement it with additional geometric constraints that twist the gradient direction to align with the typical set. We need to add **momentum**. Fortunately there is a way to do this, rooted in differential geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Physical Analogy\n",
    "For reasons rooted in the mathematics of differential geometry (which we won't derive here, because I don't understand it), for every probabilistic system there is a mathematically equivalent physical system that we can reason about more easily. Instead of thinking about a mode, a gradient, and a typical set, we can *equivalently* reason about a planet, a gravitational field, and an orbit. I imagine that if you are an astronomer, this could be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we place a satellite at rest in the gravitational field, it falls and crahses into the surface of the planet, just as a naive gradient-driven trajectory would crash into the mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "But using the physical picture, we can immediately see a solution: we can give the satelitte enough momentum to counteract the gravitational field and maintain a stable orbit. Too little momentum and it will spiral inward, too much and it flies off. But with enough momentum, the gravitational force and the dynamics are conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the key to twisting the gradient vector field into a vector field aligned with the typical set is to expand our probabilistic system with the introduction of auxiliary momentum parameters. There is only one correct way to do this, and it leads directly to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase Space\n",
    "Conservative dynamics$^♣$ in physical systems require that volumes are preserved. As the system evolves, any compression in position space must be compensated by a corresponding expansion in momentum space, and vice versa. This means that if we change our parameterisation of parameter space (say working in sin of a parameter rather than the parameter directly), we need to be able to change momentum space so that the parameter-momentum space volume is preserved. To mimic this, we introduce auxiliary momentum parameters $p_n$ to complement each dimension of the target parameter space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_n \\rightarrow (\\theta_n, p_n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expands the D-dimensional parameter space into a 2D-dimensional *phase space*. Note we are not adding a single extra dimension, we are doubling the number of dimensions. Each parameter gets a momentum parameter. \n",

    "--------\n",
    "*Note: from here on we will use $q$ rather than $\\theta$ for our parameters, following the convention of Hamiltonian mechanics where $q$ denotes co-ordinates and $p$ denotes momenta. They are the same thing: $q\\equiv\\theta$*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Also note: in the following we will use the notation $\\pi(q) \\equiv \\pi(\\theta)$ to represent a generic probability distribution function. This is not the prior, and it would be better thought of as the posterior distribution function.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*$^♣$: A system has conservative dynamics when its total energy is constant along any trajectory — nothing is gained or lost, only exchanged between kinetic and potential forms. Examples include pendulums and orbits. A consequence of energy conservation is that the dynamics preserve volumes in phase space. Liouville's theorem: if you track a cloud of initial conditions forward in time, the cloud may deform in shape but its total volume remains constant. This volume preservation is what guarantees that the dynamics don't systematically concentrate or disperse probability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Canonical Distribution\n",
    "Now that we have expanded to phase space, we need to define a *joint-*probability distribution over both position and momentum. We can't just use $\\pi(q)$ as it says nothing about $p$. And we can't pick an arbitrary joint distribution, because we need the momentum to be auxiliary: when we are done exploring, we throw it away and must be left with samples from the posterior $\\pi(q)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to construct the joint distribution as a product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(q, p) = \\pi(p|q) \\pi(q) $$\n",
    "This is called the canonical distribution. The first factor, $\\pi(p|q)$ is a conditional distribution over momentum that we get to choose (more on this shortly). The second factor is the target posterior that we have been talking about this whole time. Written this way, it is immediate from the rules of probability that we can marginalise out the momentum to recover the target:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int \\pi(q, p) dp = \\pi(q)\\cdot \\int \\pi(q| p)dp = \\pi(q)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to say that if we can build a sampler that explores the joint typical set of $\\pi(q, p)$, then simply discarding the $p$ coordinates gives us samples from $\\pi(q)$, the posterior that we care about. It is kind of like multiplying by one or adding zero in a sense. \n",

    "  By constructing a probability distribution on phase space that marginalizes to the target distribution, we ensure that the typical set on phase space projects to the typical set of the target distribution. In particular, if we can construct trajectories that efficiently explore the joint distribution (red arrow) they will project to trajectories that efficiently explore the target distribution (green arrow)\n",

    "## The Hamiltonian\n",
    "Because the canonical density does not depend on a particular choice of parameterisation, we can write it in terms of an invariant function called the Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(q,p) = e^{-H(q,p)} $$\n",
    "inverting:\n",
    "$$H(q,p)  = -\\log \\pi(q,p)$$\n",

    "Becuase of the decompositionof the joint density, the Hamiltonian itself decomposes into two terms:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- $V(q)$ is the potential energy and is completly determined by the target distribution (the posterior). This is the negative log-posterior, and it encodes the landscape the sampler must navigate.\n",
    "- $K(p,q) is the kinetic energy, our choice of momentum distribution. This is unconstrained and must be specified by the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hamiltonians Equations\n",
    "Because the Hamiltonian captures the geometry of the typical set, we should be able to use it to generate a vector field oriented with the typical set. Indeed, we can use Hamilton's Equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{dq}{dt} &= +\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial p} \\\\ \\frac{dp}{dt} &= -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = -\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial q} - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial q} \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\partial V/\\partial q$ is the gradient of the negative log-posterior which is exactly the gradient information we wanted to exploit. The equations split the gradient force (which points towards the mode/the planet) across two coupled equations. The gradient changes the momentum, not the position (directly) and the momentum changes the position. The position update $dq/dt$ moves you in the direction of the current momentum, not in the direction of the gradient. The gradient only deflects the trajectory. So these equations do twist the gradient into a vector field that follows the typical set rather than falling towards the mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the Hamiltonian vector field for some time $t$ generates trajectories $\\phi_t(q,p)$ that rapidly move through phase space while being constrained by the typical set. Projecting these trajectories back down onto the target parameter space finally yields the efficient exploration of the typical set that we have been searching for.\n",

    "## The Hamiltonian-Markov Transition\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to utilise these Hamiltonian trajectories to construct an efficient Markov transition, we need three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Step 1: **Lift**. To lift an initial point in parameter space into one in phase space, we *sample* momentum from the conditional distribution: $$p\\sim\\pi(p|q) $$ If the intial point was in the typical set of the target of the target distribution, sampling the momentum directly from its conditional distribution guarantees that the lifted point falls into the typical set of the joint phase-space distribution.\n",
    "2) Step 2: **Explore**. Once in phase space, we integrate Hamilton's equations for some time: $$(q,p) \\rightarrow \\phi_t(q,p)$$ By construction, these trajectories coherently push the transition away from the initial point while staying confined to the joint typical set.\n",
    "3) Step 3: **Project**. After integrating, we return to the parameter space by discarding the momentum: $$(q,p)\\rightarrow(q) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Composing these three steps yields a Hamiltonian Markov transition composed of random trajectories that rapidly explore the target distribution. Out in the tails, the momentum sampling and projection steps allow the chan to rapidly fall toward the typical set. Once the chain has reached the typical set, the Hamiltonian trajectories ensure extremely efficient exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Images/Jumper.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; border-radius: 4px;\">\n",

    "         (a) Each Hamiltonian Markov transition lifts the initial state onto a random level set of the Hamiltonian, which can then be explored with a Hamiltonian trajectory before projecting back down to the target parameter space. (b) If we consider the projection and random lift steps as a single momentum resampling step, then the Hamiltonian Markov chain alternates between deterministic trajectories along these level sets (dark red) and a random walk across the level sets (light red).\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Euclidean-Gaussian Kinetic Energy\n",
    "The kinetic energy $K$ (i.e. the choice of momentum distribution) is a free parameter. The standard choice is a Gaussian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(p|q) = \\mathcal{N}(p|0, M)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain language: the momentum $p$ is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution centred on zero with a covariance matrix M. Recall that $K = -\\log\\pi(p|q)$, which gives the kinetic energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K(p) = \\frac{1}{2}p^T M^{-1}p + \\text{const.} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix M is called the mass matrix (in the physical analogy), or the inverse Euclidean metric in the geometric picture. The choice of M effectively rotates and rescales parameter space. As $M^{-1}$ more closely resembles the covariance of the target distribution, the posterior becomes more isotropic in the transformed space, making the energy levels more uniform and hence easier to explore. If you are familiar with General Relativity, this may sound familiar. M is essentially the metric tensor on parameter space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal choice of $M^{-1} = \\text{Cov}_\\pi (\\theta)$, which is the posterior covariance itself. This is a bit of a chicken and the egg situation, but in practice this gets repeatedly estimated during warmup.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one might expect, it is often hard to analytical solve Hamiltons equations. Instead numerical integrators, such as leapfrog, are used. See the Betancourt 2018 paper for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "### NUTS: The No-U-Turn Sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "HMC has two tuning parameters beyond the mass matrix: the step size $\\varepsilon$ and the number of leapfrog steps $L$ (equivalently, the total integration time $T = L\\varepsilon$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The step size $\\varepsilon$ is adapted automatically during warmup by targeting a specific acceptance probability (typically 0.8). But $L$ is harder to set. Too few steps and you don't move far from the start, you get the same slow diffusion as Metropolis. Too many steps and the trajectory curves back toward the start, wasting computation. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman & Gelman 2014) eliminates $L$ as a tuning parameter entirely. It grows the trajectory in both directions (forward and backward in time) until it detects a U-turn. It then samples a point from the completed trajectory. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap the full picture: at each iteration, HMC draws a random momentum (setting a random direction and speed), then simulates a physical trajectory through parameter space using Hamilton's equations, and finally proposes the endpoint as the next sample. The trajectory is computed numerically via the leapfrog integrator, and a Metropolis correction ensures exactness despite integration error. The mass matrix $M$ rescales the posterior geometry so the sampler moves efficiently in all directions, and NUTS automates the trajectory length by stopping when a U-turn is detected. The result is a sampler that makes large, directed moves through the typical set (in contrast to the small, random, diffusive steps of Metropolis) while maintaining the detailed balance and ergodicity guarantees that make it a valid MCMC algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is basically the G.O.A.T. of MCMC algorithms.\n",

    "## How NumPyro Models Work\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPyro model is just a Python function. Inside that function, you use three key primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`numpyro.sample(\"name\", distribution)`** — declares a random variable with a prior distribution. This tells NumPyro: \"this parameter exists, and before seeing data, I believe it follows this distribution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`numpyro.sample(\"name\", distribution, obs=data)`** — declares an observed random variable. This is the likelihood: it says \"the data was generated from this distribution, given the current parameter values.\" The `obs=data` keyword is what distinguishes a prior from a likelihood in NumPyro.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`numpyro.factor(\"name\", log_value)`** — adds an arbitrary log-density contribution to the model's log-probability, without declaring a new random variable. This is useful for custom likelihoods that don't correspond to a built-in distribution. You can think of `numpyro.sample(\"obs\", dist, obs=data)` as syntactic sugar that internally calls `numpyro.factor` with the log-probability of `data` under `dist`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. From these three primitives, NumPyro automatically constructs the log-posterior $\\log[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)\\pi(\\theta)]$, computes its gradient via JAX autodiff, and runs NUTS.\n",
    "\n",
