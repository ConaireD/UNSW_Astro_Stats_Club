    "In 1915, Albert Einstein presented his work on the Theory of General Relativity. In September of 2015, LIGO announced the detection of gravitational waves, a resulted predicted by General Relativity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1:** Upon hearing this, where you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a) More inclined to belief that GR was a good model of reality.\n",
    "- b) Less inclined to belief that GR was a good model of reality.\n",
    "- c) Neither. While GR survived another test, my belief about the validity of GR remained unchanged.\n",

    "If you answered a), you are a Bayesian. You updated your belief about a hypothesis (GR is correct) based on new evidence (LIGO detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered b), you are lying.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answered (c), you are a frequentist. Under frequentism, hypotheses don't have probabilities; they are either true or false. The data can only reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis. Feels a bit silly that this is the only valid frequentist interpretation doesn't it?\n",

    "**Question 2:** LIGO reported a $5\\sigma$ detection. If you were a frequentist, how would you interpret this? \n",

    "- a) There is a $>99.9999%$ probability that gravitational waves exist\n",
    "- b) There is a $>99.9999%$ probability that GR is correct\n",
    "- c) Assuming gravitational waves do not exist, the probability of observing data at least this extreme due to noise is $<1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n",
    "- d) The result is so unlikely under the null hypothesis that we can be essentially certain the null hypothesis is false.\n",

    "- a) There is a 95% probability that the true value of the black hole lies between \\[3.1, 7.3\\] solar masses.\n",
    "- b) There is a 5% probability that the true value of the black hole is outside of this interval.\n",
    "- c) The parameter lies in this interval with high confidence, but we cannot assign a probability to that statement.\n",
